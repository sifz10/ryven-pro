This creates:
- **Admin User**: admin@example.com / password
- **Customer User**: customer@example.com / password
- **Sample Proposals**: 3 sample proposals for the customer

### 3. Build Frontend Assets
```bash
npm run build
# or for development
npm run dev
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Usage

### Admin Access
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Login with: `admin@example.com` / `password`
3. Access:
   - Dashboard with system-wide statistics
   - Users menu to manage all users
   - All Proposals menu to manage all proposals

### Customer Access
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Login with: `customer@example.com` / `password`
3. Access:
   - Dashboard with personal statistics
   - My Proposals menu to view own proposals
   - Profile management

### Creating New Admin Users
1. Login as an existing admin
2. Navigate to Users ‚Üí Add New User
3. Fill in the form and select "Admin" role
4. Submit

### Proposal Status Flow
1. **Pending** - Initial status when created
2. **In Progress** - Being worked on
3. **Completed** - Finished and ready
4. **Rejected** - Not approved

## Components

### Reusable React Components
- `StatsCard` - Dashboard statistics cards
- `Badge` - Status badges with color variants
- `EmptyState` - Empty state displays
- Standard form components (TextInput, InputLabel, etc.)

### Layouts
- `AuthenticatedLayout` - Main app layout with role-based navigation
- `GuestLayout` - Public pages layout

## Security Features

- Role-based middleware (`admin` middleware)
- Customer data isolation (users can only see their own proposals)
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Password hashing
- Email verification support
- Session management

## Customization

### Adding New Roles
1. Update the `role` field validation in User model
2. Add middleware if needed
3. Update navigation in `AuthenticatedLayout.jsx`
4. Create role-specific controllers and views

### Changing Theme Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize colors, or update the color classes in components.

### Adding More Stats
Update `DashboardController.php` to add more statistics, then update the Dashboard page to display them.

## Best Practices

1. **Admin users** should manage user roles carefully
2. **Keep passwords secure** - Change default passwords immediately
3. **Regular backups** - Back up the database regularly
4. **Monitor activity** - Track admin actions in production
5. **Update dependencies** - Keep packages up to date

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't access admin pages
**Solution**: Make sure your user has `role = 'admin'` in the database

### Issue: Proposals not showing
**Solution**: Check if `user_id` is properly set on leads

### Issue: Navigation not updating
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and rebuild assets with `npm run build`

### Issue: 403 Forbidden on admin routes
**Solution**: Verify middleware is registered in `bootstrap/app.php`

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Activity logs for admin actions
- Email notifications for status changes
- Bulk operations (delete, update status)
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Data export (CSV, Excel)
- User avatar uploads
- Comments/notes on proposals
- Team collaboration features
